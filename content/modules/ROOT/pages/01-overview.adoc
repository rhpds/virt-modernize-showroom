== Background
OpenShift Virtualization with Service Mesh and GitOps modernizes virtual machine operations by integrating them seamlessly with cloud-native technologies, enabling enterprises to achieve modern platform capabilities without rewriting applications.

TravelCorp is a travel agency with a hybrid architecture consisting of both containerized microservices and legacy virtual machines that handle critical business functions like booking systems and payment processing.

Their current challenges include:

* Isolated VM management requiring separate tooling and processes
* Limited observability and security for VM-based workloads
* Manual VM scaling and deployment processes
* Lack of unified governance across VMs and containers
* Difficulty applying modern DevOps practices to legacy workloads

== Problem
Traditional VM operations result in:

* **Operational complexity** - Managing two separate platforms (VMs and containers)
* **Security gaps** - VMs lack modern security capabilities like mTLS and policy enforcement
* **Limited visibility** - No unified observability across the entire application stack
* **Manual processes** - Slow, error-prone deployments and scaling
* **Compliance challenges** - Difficulty maintaining consistent governance across workloads

== Benefits to the Customer

* No application rewrites required

*Unified Operations:*

* Single platform management for VMs and containers
* Consistent tooling, processes, and skills across all workloads
* Reduced operational complexity and training costs

*Enterprise Security:*

* Automatic mTLS encryption between all workloads
* Unified security policies across VMs and containers
* Zero-trust networking with microsegmentation

*Operational Efficiency:*

* Kubernetes-native VM lifecycle management
* Automated scaling and resource optimization
* GitOps-driven deployment and configuration management

*Complete Observability:*

* End-to-end tracing across VMs and containers
* Unified metrics and monitoring dashboards
* Service topology visualization including VMs

== Common Customer Questions to be Ready For

*How does this work with our existing VM infrastructure?*

* OpenShift Virtualization runs VMs as Kubernetes objects alongside containers
* Existing VM images can be migrated with minimal changes
* Maintains VM performance while adding cloud-native capabilities

*What about security and compliance for VMs?*

* Service Mesh provides automatic mTLS encryption for VM communications
* Unified policy enforcement across all workloads
* Complete audit trails and compliance reporting

*How complex is the implementation?*

* VMs become Kubernetes resources managed declaratively
* GitOps automation reduces manual intervention
* Self-service capabilities through templates and catalogs

*What's the migration timeline and business impact?*

* Immediate benefits: unified management and enhanced security
* Progressive modernization: containerize components when ready
* Proven results: 60% reduction in operational complexity
