include::vars.adoc[]

This guide helps sales engineers and technical presenters deliver an effective OpenShift Virtualization with Service Mesh and GitOps demonstration to customers.

Every demo is different and you will have to adapt this guide to your specific needs.
For instance, if you have less than the noted amount of time, you can skip some of the sections.

The following sections will help you understand the guide and how to use it to prepare and execute the demo.

== Demo Overview
The **Demo Overview** section provides background, use case, and benefits to the customer.

IMPORTANT: Read the **Demo Overview** thoroughly to understand the scenario and the business context.

=== Background
Modern enterprises are struggling to modernize their VM-based applications while maintaining operational efficiency. They need to leverage cloud-native capabilities without completely rewriting their applications.

=== Business Outcomes
* VM modernization without application rewrites
* Unified platform management for VMs and containers
* Enterprise-grade security with zero-trust networking
* 60% reduction in operational complexity
* Automated VM lifecycle management and scaling

=== Module Paths Based on Customer Focus
* Module 1 (VM Modernization Foundation) for IT leadership and infrastructure teams
* Module 2 (VM Scaling) for operations and infrastructure teams
* Module 3 (Service Mesh Integration) for security and platform engineering teams
* Module 4 (Advanced Traffic Management) for application and DevOps teams
* Module 5 (GitOps Automation) for platform engineering and compliance teams

All paths deliver the same outcome: modernized VM operations with cloud-native capabilities.

== Demo Details
The **Demo Details** section contains technical requirements, proposed timing, credentials, and troubleshooting tips. See xref:02-details.adoc[Demo Details] for the complete breakdown.

== Demo Modules
This is the main content of the demo.
Most sections are written with both a **Know** and a **Show** section.

=== Know
Content in the **Know** section is a mix of background and insights for you and the customer.
It will describe what you are going to show and why it is important.

It is not a script for you to follow, so make sure you read it thoroughly and understand the what and the why of what you will show.

You'll often find additional information covering:

* Business Challenge
* Technical Solution
* Business Value

=== Show
Content in the **Show** section is a step-by-step guide for you to follow.
There will be less narrative in these sections with the focus on what you need to do.

Unless otherwise noted, you need to follow the steps in the **Show** section in order.

== Next Steps
Read the **Demo Overview** and **Demo Details**.  
Choose the appropriate modules based on the customer's priorities and time constraints, then follow the **Know** and **Show** steps to deliver the demo.
