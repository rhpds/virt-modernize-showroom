**Value Props:**
- **Risk-free deployments** - Test new versions with minimal user impact
- **Automatic failover** - Self-healing systems reduce downtime
- **Modern DevOps practices** - Apply cloud-native patterns to legacy apps
- **Enhanced reliability** - Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures

**Target Audience:** Application Teams, DevOps Engineers

---

### Module 5: GitOps Automation (3-4 minutes)
**Business Challenge:** VM management is manual, inconsistent, and lacks automation

**Demo Elements:**
- ArgoCD managing VM deployments declaratively
- Git-driven configuration management
- Automatic drift detection and correction
- Rollback capabilities for VM changes

**Value Props:**
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Version-controlled VM configurations
- **Automated operations** - Reduce manual tasks and human error
- **Compliance and audit** - Full traceability of all changes
- **Consistent deployments** - Same VM config across environments

**Target Audience:** DevOps Engineers, Platform Engineers, Compliance Teams
